## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

I LEARNED HOW TO IMPORT EXTERNAL FONTS IN MY WEBSITE THROUGH CSS USING THE @font-face{}
code snippet:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: Figtree;
    src: url('assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf');
}
```

### Continued development

I would love to master the art of animation in CSS in the future.

### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand @font-face. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
